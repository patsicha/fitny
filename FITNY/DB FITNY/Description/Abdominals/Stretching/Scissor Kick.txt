	1.	To begin, lie down with your back pressed against the floor or on an exercise mat (optional). Your arms should be fully extended to the sides with your palms facing down. Note: The arms should be stationary the entire time.
	2.	With a slight bend at the knees, lift your legs up so that your heels are about 6 inches off the ground. This is the starting position.
	3.	Now lift your left leg up to about a 45 degree angle while your right leg is lowered until the heel is about 2-3 inches from the ground.
	4.	Switch movements by raising your right leg up and lowering your left leg. Remember to breathe while performing this exercise.
	5.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: As you get more advanced, you can wear ankle weights for resistance.
