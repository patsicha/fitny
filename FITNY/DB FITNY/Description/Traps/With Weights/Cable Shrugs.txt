	1.	Grasp a cable bar attachment that is attached to a low pulley with a shoulder width or slightly wider overhand (palms facing down) grip.
	2.	Stand erect close to the pulley with your arms extended in front of you holding the bar. This will be your starting position.
	3.	Lift the bar by elevating the shoulders as high as possible as you exhale. Hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: The arms should remain extended at all times. Refrain from using the biceps to help lift the bar. Only the shoulders should be moving up and down.
	4.	Lower the bar back to the original position.
	5.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations: You can perform this exercise with bands, barbells or dumbbell. You can also use a single handle and work one side at a time.
