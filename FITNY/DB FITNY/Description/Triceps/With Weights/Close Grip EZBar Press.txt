	1.	Lie on a flat bench with an EZ bar loaded to an appropriate weight.
	2.	Using a narrow grip lift the bar and hold it straight over your torso with your elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
	3.	Now lower the bar down to your lower chest as you breathe in. Keep the elbows in as you perform this movement.
	4.	Using the triceps to push the bar back up, press it back to the starting position by extending the elbows as you exhale.
	5.	Repeat.
