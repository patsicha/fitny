	1.	Stand with your hands behind your head, and squat down keeping your torso upright and your head up. This will be your starting position.
	2.	Jump forward several feet, avoiding jumping unnecessarily high. As your feet contact the ground, absorb the impact through your legs, and jump again. Repeat this action 5-10 times.
