	1.	Begin with a box or bench 1-2 feet in front of you. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.
	2.	Perform a short squat in preparation for the jump; swing your arms behind you.
	3.	Rebound out of this position, extending through the hips, knees, and ankles to jump as high as possible. Swing your arms forward and up.
	4.	Jump over the bench, landing with the knees bent, absorbing the impact through the legs.
	5.	Turn around and face the opposite direction, then jump back over the bench.
