	1.	Start out by placing two dumbbells on one side of a flat bench.
	2.	Kneel down on both of your knees so that your body is facing the flat bench.
	3.	Use your arms to grab both of the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms up) and bring them up so that your forearms are resting against the flat bench. Your wrists should be hanging over the edge.
	4.	Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling.
	5.	Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Make sure to inhale during this part of the exercise.
	6.	Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise.
	7.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variations:

	•	This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed.
	•	You can also use a barbell instead of a dumbbell.
