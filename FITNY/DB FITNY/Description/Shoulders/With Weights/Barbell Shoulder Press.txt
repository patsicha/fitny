	1.	Sit on a bench with back support in a squat rack. Position a barbell at a height that is just above your head. Grab the barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing forward).

	3.	Lower the bar down to the shoulders slowly as you inhale.
	4.	Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale.
	5.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
