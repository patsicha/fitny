	1.	Grab a dumbbell in each arm and stand up straight with your arms extended by your sides with a slight bend at the elbows and your back straight. This will be your starting position. Tip: The dumbbell should be next to your thighs with the palm of your hands facing back.
	2.	Use your side shoulders to lift the dumbbells as you exhale. The dumbbells should be to the side of the body as you move them up. Continue to lift it until the dumbbells are nearly in line with your chin. Tip: Your elbows should drive the motion. As you lift the dumbbell, your elbow should always be higher than your forearm. Also, keep your torso stationary and pause for a second at the top of the movement.
	3.	Lower the dumbbells back down slowly to the starting position. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.
	4.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
	5.	
Caution: Be very careful with how much weight you use in this exercise. Too much weight leads to bad form, which in turn can cause shoulder injury. I've seen this too many times so please no jerking, swinging and cheating. Also, if you suffer from shoulder problems, you may want to stay away from this movement and substitute by some form of lateral raises.
Variations: This exercise can also be performed using a straight bar attached to a low pulley and it can also be performed using an e-z bar, cables and exercise band.
