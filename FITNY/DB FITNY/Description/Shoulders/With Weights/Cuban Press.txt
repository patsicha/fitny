	1.	From a seated or standing position, hold a dumbbell in each hand with your shoulders rotated forward. Your arms should be fully extended next to your thighs with only a slight bend at the elbows and with the palms of your hands facing your thighs. This will be your starting position.
	2.	Begin the movement by lifting the elbows up, as if performing a dumbbell upright row, until they are at shoulder height. Tip: The torso and the upper arm should resemble the letter "T". Exhale as you perform this movement.
	3.	Once you reach this position, inhale and then externally rotate the dumbbells up while keeping the upper arms in the same level and exhaling. Continue this movement until the forearms are perpendicular to the floor and the hands are pointing towards the ceiling. Inhale once you complete this movement.
	4.	Now press the dumbbells up over your head as if performing a shoulder press as you exhale.
	5.	Go back to the initial position as you breathe in by reversing the steps.
	6.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Variation: You can also use a barbell.
