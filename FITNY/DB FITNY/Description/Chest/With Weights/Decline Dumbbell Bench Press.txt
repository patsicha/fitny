	1.	Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.
	2.	Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width.
	3.	Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position.
	4.	Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe out. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Tip: Throughout the motion, the forearms should always be perpendicular to the floor.
	5.	As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up..
	6.	Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.

Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you.
If using really heavy weights, it is best if a partner gives them to you as you lay down.
Variations: You can use an exercise band or a barbell to perform this exercise.
